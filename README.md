# fastGPT

The progression of GPT-2 codes from the original to "minimal", "nano" and
"pico":

* [openai/gpt-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2)
* [karpathy/minGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/mingpt)
* [karpathy/nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanogpt)
* [jaymody/picoGPT](https://github.com/jaymody/picoGPT)

`fastGPT` is very similar to `picoGPT` (very small and readable), but it is
also fast (see the Benchmarks section below). The speed and readability is
achieved by using Fortran. I wrote a
[blog post](https://ondrejcertik.com/blog/2023/03/fastgpt-faster-than-pytorch-in-300-lines-of-fortran/)
introducing fastGPT.

`fastGPT` features:
* Fast? ✅
* Training code? ❌
* Batch inference? ❌
* top-p sampling? ❌ top-k? ❌ temperature? ❌ categorical sampling?! ❌ greedy? ✅
* Readable? ✅
* Small? ✅

A quick breakdown of each of the files:

* `gpt2.f90`: the actual GPT-2 model and a decoder
* `main.f90`: the main driver
* `create_model.py`: downloads the TensorFlow model and converts to the GGUF
  format (`model.gguf`)
* `encode_input.py`: encodes the text input into tokens (input file for `gpt2`)
* Matmul implementations
    * `linalg_f.f90` native Fortran
    * `linalg_c.f90`, `linalg_accelerate.c` macOS Accelerate Framework
* `pt.py`: a reference script to run PyTorch (returns the same answer)

## Getting Started

### Install prerequisites:
```bash
    mamba env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate fastgpt
```

### Configure and build
#### Fortran Package Manager (fpm)
```bash
    fpm build
```

#### CMake 
```bash
    FC=gfortran cmake .
    make
```

### Download the GPT2 model weights

    curl -o model.gguf -L https://huggingface.co/certik/fastGPT/resolve/main/model_fastgpt_124M_v2.gguf

You can also download 355M for the `gpt-medium` model.

Now you can modify the `input` file to change the input string and set other
parameters.

### Run 
(requires `model.gguf` and `input` in the current directory)

If you built with `cmake`, execute
```bash
    ./gpt2
```
Alternatively, if you built with `fpm`, execute
```bash
    fpm run gpt2
```

### Create the GGUF file

Create the `model.gguf` file from a given GPT-2 model. Supported sizes (and the
corresponding names to be used in `pt.py`, and the approximate download size):
"124M" (`gpt2`, 0.5GB), "355M" (`gpt-medium`, 1.5GB), "774M" (`gpt-large`,
3GB), "1558M" (`gpt-xl`, 6GB). This will download the model and cache it for
subsequent runs:
```python
    python create_model.py --models_dir "models" --model_size "124M"
```

This script depends on the `gguf` Python library, that you can install using:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
    cd llama.cpp
    git checkout 4e9a7f7f7fb6acbddd1462909c8d696e38edbfcc
    cd gguf-py
    pip install .
```
The `gguf` library is available in pip and conda, but we currently require the
latest version that is not available there yet.

We used this script to create several GGUF files and uploaded them to:
https://huggingface.co/certik/fastGPT, so that you can just download the
pre-generated files.

### Example Output

The above `./gpt2` command prints on Apple M1 Max:
```

### Chat interface

Here is an example chat using the largest 1558M model:

```
$ ./chat
Your name is fastGPT and you are an AI bot. The user will ask you questions and you answer in a nice, truthful, short way.
User: What is the capital of Czechia?
fastGPT: Prague.

### BLAS Implementation

You can choose which BLAS implementation to use for `matmul` using:
* `-DFASTGPT_BLAS=OpenBLAS`: Use OpenBLAS
* `-DFASTGPT_BLAS=Accelerate`: Use the macOS Accelerate Framework
* `-DFASTGPT_BLAS=Fortran`: Use the default Fortran's intrinsic `matmul`
